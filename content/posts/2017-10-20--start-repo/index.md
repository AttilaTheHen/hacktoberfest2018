If you'd like to start practicing in this repo before moving onto another repo, please do so! Here is a basic guide to setting up this project and starting to contribute:

## Set Up: Node, NPM and NVM

This site is a Gatsby blog, using the [Hero Blog starter template](https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-hero-blog). Gatsby is a great way to set up a personal site easily, especially if you know or want to learn React. For more information on Gatsby, visit their documentation site here:

### Set Up: Repo

Start by forking this repo in GitHub, and cloning *your forked copy of the repo* down to your desktop using `git clone`:

HTTPS:
```
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR USERNAME]/hacktoberfest2018.git
```

Once the site is cloned down, enter the directory and open it in the code editor of your choice (we recommend using VS Code). Run `npm i`.

Once done, run:

```
gatsby develop
```

to see a working dev version of the website and start editing!

### Contributing

- Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b username/branchname`)
- Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some puppy pictures to About'`)
